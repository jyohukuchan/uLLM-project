# aq quantization research

## Work

- Downloaded and verified `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` BF16 safetensors.
- Downloaded and verified `unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF` `Qwen3.5-9B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf`.
- Reused existing local `AxionML-Qwen3.5-9B-NVFP4` safetensors.
- Added NVFP4 tensor error comparison tooling.
- Added GGUF tensor error comparison tooling via llama.cpp `gguf-py`.
- Extended aq tensor sampler:
  - explicit CPU thread recording,
  - Qwen3.5 `linear_attn` family labels,
  - family-balanced tensor selection,
  - Lloyd-refined codebook candidates,
  - group-size sweep candidates.

## Results

- NVFP4 baseline:
  - result: `benchmarks/results/2026-07-01/aq/2026-07-01-nvfp4-error-qwen35-9b.jsonl`
  - mean relative MSE: `0.008996`
  - mean cosine similarity: `0.995502`

- Unsloth Dynamic Q4_K_XL reliable subset:
  - result: `benchmarks/results/2026-07-01/aq/2026-07-01-udq4kxl-error-qwen35-9b-mlp-selfattn.jsonl`
  - mean relative MSE: `0.004175`
  - mean cosine similarity: `0.997911`
  - linear-attention rows are excluded from the reliable summary because simple GGUF-to-HF mapping produced very large errors.

- aq round2 best:
  - result: `benchmarks/results/2026-07-01/aq/2026-07-01-aq-round2-qwen35-9b-balanced.jsonl`
  - best candidate: `aq4_e4m3_g16_ts_flloyd16`
  - mean relative MSE: `0.005255`
  - scale-window 16 rerun: `0.005235`, only a small improvement.

- aq group-size sweep:
  - result: `benchmarks/results/2026-07-01/aq/2026-07-01-aq-round3-qwen35-9b-group-sizes.jsonl`
  - g64 / 4.125 bpp: `0.008292`
  - g32 / 4.25 bpp: `0.006873`
  - g16 / 4.50 bpp: `0.005244`
  - g8 / 5.00 bpp: `0.003573`

## Current Interpretation

Concrete measurement should continue in parallel with quantizer optimization. A separate long theory-only phase is not useful now, but full-model conversion will require a dedicated CPU-multithreaded quantizer implementation.

The current aq result is promising at 4.5 bpp: it beats sampled NVFP4 and slightly beats sampled UD `Q4_K` rows, but it still uses sample-local codebooks. Family-level or tensor-level LUT storage must be tested before treating it as a real format result.

## Next

- Add family-level LUT aggregation to the sampler.
- Resolve GGUF Qwen3.5 linear-attention tensor mapping.
- Start a full quantizer design that avoids Python element loops and supports chunked CPU-multithreaded execution.
- Add a small model-level check after tensor-level candidate narrowing.
